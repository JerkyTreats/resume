## Style Guide

* Do NOT maintain backwards compatibliity. The code should be correct to most recent spec.
* Favor early errors over fallback strategies. If there is an error, we want to know early and have it triggering as close to the original source of the problem as possible.
* Write modular, isolated code.
* Use Typescript/Node idiomatic best practices.
